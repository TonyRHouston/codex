# Checklist-Driven Delivery

## When to use
- Delivering features with explicit quality gates
- Running structured reviews and handoffs

## Core workflow
1. Define the checklist for the phase
2. Track completion and evidence
3. Gate progress on required checks

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Checklists without evidence
- Skipping items due to time pressure
- Mixing phases without clear boundaries

## Output expectations
- Checklist with status and evidence
- Remaining risks and follow-ups
