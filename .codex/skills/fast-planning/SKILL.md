# Fast Planning Workflow

## Philosophy
Speed is prioritized over exhaustive edge-case mapping. Focus on the "happy path" first.

## Workflow
1. **Core Objective**: Define the single most important outcome of this task.
2. **Minimal Path**: Identify the fewest possible file changes to achieve the objective.
3. **Immediate Steps**: List 3-5 concrete terminal commands or edits.
4. **Execution**: Proceed immediately to implementation.

## Critical Constraints
- Do not spend > 5 minutes on planning documentation.
- Use existing patterns exclusively; avoid introducing new abstractions.
