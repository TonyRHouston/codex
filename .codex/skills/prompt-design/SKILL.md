# Prompt Design

## When to use
- Creating or refining prompt templates for agents
- Designing plan/implement instruction flows

## Core workflow
1. Identify the task phase (plan, implement, review, update)
2. Define required behaviors and constraints
3. Keep prompts concise, testable, and role-aligned
4. Validate with minimal examples

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Vague prompts without triggers or constraints
- Overly long prompts that repeat common knowledge
- Prompts that conflict with existing system instructions

## Output expectations
- Prompt purpose and trigger conditions
- Example usage and expected behavior

## References
- Read references/prompt-templates.md
- Read references/exit-confirmation-design.md for a concrete pattern
