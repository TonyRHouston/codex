# azure-role-selector

## When to use
- Use when the user request explicitly maps to **azure role selector** outcomes.
- Use when consistent, repeatable outputs are more important than ad-hoc responses.

## Decision Framework
Before acting, evaluate the **why**, trade-off, and risk profile:
- **Why now**: what user outcome or blocker is this skill resolving?
- **Trade-off**: what speed vs quality decision is acceptable for this turn?
- **Scope boundary**: what is in-scope for this skill vs another domain skill?
- **Verification strategy**: what concrete check proves the result is correct?

## Workflow
1. Confirm intent, constraints, and expected output format.
2. Apply this skill's domain logic to produce a first-pass result.
3. Validate the result against correctness, safety, and completeness checks.
4. Refine output and state assumptions, limitations, and next action clearly.

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Never proceed when intent is ambiguous and high-impact decisions are involved.
- Never mix unrelated domain steps without an explicit decision to do so.
- Do not ship output that has not been validated against the requested constraints.
- Avoid placeholder text, guessed facts, or silent omissions in final output.
- Never use this skill when a more specific skill is clearly the better fit.
- Don't skip verification because an initial result "looks right".

## Output Expectations
- Clear, task-aligned result with explicit assumptions.
- Evidence of validation steps performed.
- Concise summary of what was done and what remains.

## Existing Notes
Use 'Azure MCP/documentation' tool to find the minimal role definition that matches the desired permissions the user wants to assign to an identity (If no built-in role matches the desired permissions, use 'Azure MCP/extension_cli_generate' tool to create a custom role definition with the desired permissions). Use 'Azure MCP/extension_cli_generate' tool to generate the CLI commands needed to assign that role to the identity and use the 'Azure MCP/bicepschema' and the 'Azure MCP/get_bestpractices' tool to provide a Bicep code snippet for adding the role assignment.
