# MCP Sequential Thinking Server

## When to use
- Complex reasoning needing iterative steps
- Planning with revisions or branches

## Core workflow
1. Provide thought, number, total
2. Use revision/branch fields for changes
3. Continue until nextThoughtNeeded=false

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Skip thought numbering
- Use for trivial single-step tasks

## Output expectations
- Structured thought sequence
- Final conclusion or plan

## References
- Read references/sequential-thinking.md
