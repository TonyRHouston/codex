# Algorithms and Optimization

## When to use
- Optimizing algorithm performance and complexity
- Choosing data structures for specific access patterns

## Core workflow
1. Classify the problem type (search, optimization, graph, etc.)
2. Select algorithm paradigm (DP, greedy, divide/conquer)
3. Choose data structure aligned to access patterns
4. Analyze time/space complexity and trade-offs

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Optimize without measuring or defining constraints
- Use complex structures when simpler ones suffice
- Ignore worst-case complexity for critical paths

## Output expectations
- Problem classification and chosen paradigm
- Complexity analysis and trade-offs
- Proposed algorithm and data structure
