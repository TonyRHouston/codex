# skills-skill-installer-skill

## When to use
- Use when the user request explicitly maps to **skills skill installer skill** outcomes.
- Use when consistent, repeatable outputs are more important than ad-hoc responses.

## Decision Framework
Before acting, evaluate the **why**, trade-off, and risk profile:
- **Why now**: what user outcome or blocker is this skill resolving?
- **Trade-off**: what speed vs quality decision is acceptable for this turn?
- **Scope boundary**: what is in-scope for this skill vs another domain skill?
- **Verification strategy**: what concrete check proves the result is correct?

## Workflow
1. Confirm intent, constraints, and expected output format.
2. Apply this skill's domain logic to produce a first-pass result.
3. Validate the result against correctness, safety, and completeness checks.
4. Refine output and state assumptions, limitations, and next action clearly.

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Never proceed when intent is ambiguous and high-impact decisions are involved.
- Never mix unrelated domain steps without an explicit decision to do so.
- Do not ship output that has not been validated against the requested constraints.
- Avoid placeholder text, guessed facts, or silent omissions in final output.
- Never use this skill when a more specific skill is clearly the better fit.
- Don't skip verification because an initial result "looks right".

## Output Expectations
- Clear, task-aligned result with explicit assumptions.
- Evidence of validation steps performed.
- Concise summary of what was done and what remains.

## Existing Notes
# Skill Installer

Helps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/TonyRHouston/.github/tree/main/skills, but users can also provide other locations.

Use the helper scripts based on the task:
- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.
- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.
- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).

Install skills with the helper scripts.

## Communication

When listing curated skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request:
"""
Skills from {repo}:
1. skill-1
2. skill-2 (already installed)
3. ...
Which ones would you like installed?
"""

After installing a skill, tell the user: "Restart Codex to pick up new skills."

## Scripts

All of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.

- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py` (prints curated list with installed annotations)
- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py --format json`
- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`
- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`

## Behavior and Options

- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.
- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.
- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.
- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).
- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.
- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.

## Notes

- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/TonyRHouston/.github/tree/main/skills` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.
- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.
- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.
- The core skills in this repository are already available, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.
- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.
