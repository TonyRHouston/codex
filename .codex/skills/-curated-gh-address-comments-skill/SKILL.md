# -curated-gh-address-comments-skill

## When to use
- Use when the user request explicitly maps to ** curated gh address comments skill** outcomes.
- Use when consistent, repeatable outputs are more important than ad-hoc responses.

## Decision Framework
Before acting, evaluate the **why**, trade-off, and risk profile:
- **Why now**: what user outcome or blocker is this skill resolving?
- **Trade-off**: what speed vs quality decision is acceptable for this turn?
- **Scope boundary**: what is in-scope for this skill vs another domain skill?
- **Verification strategy**: what concrete check proves the result is correct?

## Workflow
1. Confirm intent, constraints, and expected output format.
2. Apply this skill's domain logic to produce a first-pass result.
3. Validate the result against correctness, safety, and completeness checks.
4. Refine output and state assumptions, limitations, and next action clearly.

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)
- Never proceed when intent is ambiguous and high-impact decisions are involved.
- Never mix unrelated domain steps without an explicit decision to do so.
- Do not ship output that has not been validated against the requested constraints.
- Avoid placeholder text, guessed facts, or silent omissions in final output.
- Never use this skill when a more specific skill is clearly the better fit.
- Don't skip verification because an initial result "looks right".

## Output Expectations
- Clear, task-aligned result with explicit assumptions.
- Evidence of validation steps performed.
- Concise summary of what was done and what remains.

## Existing Notes
# PR Comment Handler

Guide to find the open PR for the current branch and address its comments with gh CLI. Run all `gh` commands with elevated network access.

Prereq: ensure `gh` is authenticated (for example, run `gh auth login` once), then run `gh auth status` with escalated permissions (include workflow/repo scopes) so `gh` commands succeed. If sandboxing blocks `gh auth status`, rerun it with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.

## 1) Inspect comments needing attention
- Run scripts/fetch_comments.py which will print out all the comments and review threads on the PR

## 2) Ask the user for clarification
- Number all the review threads and comments and provide a short summary of what would be required to apply a fix for it
- Ask the user which numbered comments should be addressed

## 3) If user chooses comments
- Apply fixes for the selected comments

Notes:
- If gh hits auth/rate issues mid-run, prompt the user to re-authenticate with `gh auth login`, then retry.
